Halloween !!!  _exclamation_ 
Tonight I will _adverb_ _actionverb_ 
as a _adjective_ , _adjective_ _animal_ .
Will I get a _noun_ again?
I hope I don't meet a _adjective_ , _adjective_ _animal_ 
like last year when I screamed _exclamation_ and _actionverb_
and all I really wanted was _halloweentreat_ .
